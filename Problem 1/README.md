Problem 1 explores process fundamentals.  

How to run Problem 1-a:  
	1- Open terminal and swith your current directory to this one.  
	2- Copy&paste 'gcc p1a.c -o p1a' to the terminal to compile the file.  
	3- After the compilation is done, simply enter './p1a' command to the terminal to run the program.  

How to run Problem 1-b:  
	1- Open terminal and swith your current directory to this one.  
	2- Copy&paste 'gcc p2b.c -o p1b' to the terminal to compile the file.  
	3- After the compilation is done, simply enter './p2b <command_name>' or './p2b <command_name> <command_arg>' command to the terminal to run the program.  
	4- 'pwd' and 'ps f' can be used as examples.  

How to run Problem 1-c:  
	1- Open terminal and swith your current directory to this one.  
	2- Copy&paste 'gcc p1c.c -o p1c' to the terminal to compile the file.  
	3- After the compilation is done, simply enter './p1c &' to the terminal to run the program in the background.  
	4- Then simple type 'ps -l' to the command line to check whether the process is a zombie or not. This can be seen by checking the 'S' column. If its a zombie the state would be 'Z'.
